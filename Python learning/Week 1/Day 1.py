print('these are notes down below ^ oppsite way round')

# this is a comment, this is used for ignoring the test basically telling the computer not to use it
# this is good to use for adding notes or whatever the fuck you wanna do just the computer doesnt recongnize it 
# not sure what exactly it is useful for but it is a good concept to write/jot notes on the side

print('down below are multiline quotations to like 3 little tag things ^')

'''so the rn is a multiline i guess its really the same as the comments not very realiable''' 

'''just like the comments the multiline quoetations are not assigned to nuthing so its not gonna be recongnized by code'''
''' last one they really just comments not usefull unless you wanna take notes on the side '''


   #                                    Data types
   # in python there is multple data types

#                     Numbers 
# Integer : (negative, zero, postive)
# Float   : Decimal # Ex > 4.5, 6.0, ..........
# Complex : 1 + p, 7 + h

#                                        Strings
# A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quotations. if a string is longer then 1 setence we use triple quotes > ''' '''
# Ex > 'Panacakes' , 'today is Wednesday' , "Theres is 365 days in a year" , ''' this is using 3 quotations because this is a multi sentence string. Thus we are going to use 3 quotaions'''
# 'this is a string' , ' When we write print and use for example Balloon we do > print ('Balloon') < see how i used the quotes 
print ('Balloon')

#                                       Booleans 
# is a data type that is either True or False > T and F should always be uppercase 
# Ex  True > is the light on? if it is on, then the value is True
#    False>  is the off? if it is off, then the value is False 

#                                        List 
# is an ordered collection which allows to store different data types
#Example >  
#          [1,2,3,4,5] > all the same the data types - A list of Numbers 
#          ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango'] - A list of strings (fruits)
#          ['United States', 'Oman', 'Ireland'] - A list of (Countries)
#          ['Mango', True, 3.14, 90] > different data types in the list - string, Boolean, Float, integer

#                                       Dictionary 
# is an unordered collection of data collection of data in a key: value pair format
# Ex > {'name' : 'Leonidas', 'country' : 'Canada', age:300, 'is_married': False}

#                                      Tuple 
# A ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples CANNOT be modified once they are created!
# Ex > ('Leo', 'Jackson', 'Max', 'Golden', 'Apple')

#                                       Set
# A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple. Unlike list and tuple, set is not an ordered collection of items
# Ex > {3.14, 9.56, 5.5} - order is not important in set

#                                  Checking data types 
#  To check the data type of a certain data/variable we use the _type_ function 
#Ex >
